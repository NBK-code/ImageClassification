# ImageClassification
In this project we build two different image classification models for the SVHN Dataset - the MLP (MultiLayer Perceptron) model and the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model. The MLP model is made out of just dense layers and hence does not take into account of the 2D structure of the input data. On the other hand, the CNN model consisting of CNN layers makes complete use of the 2d structure of the images. After training each of the models, it is demonstrated that for the same number of epochs of training and a similar test set accuracy, MLP model requires a lot more parameters than the CNN model.
